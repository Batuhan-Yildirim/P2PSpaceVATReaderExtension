## Features

  - Swiss: Accepts all common formats (e.g., `CHE-123.456.789`, `CHE123456789`, `CHE123.456.789`, etc.), always outputs as `CHE-123.456.789`
- **OCR support** for images using [Tesseract.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js).
- **Tab-based UI** for switching between extraction modes.
- **Delete/Clear buttons** for each section.
- **Responsive and modern popup UI**.

## Development

- **OCR:** Uses Tesseract.js for extracting text from images/screenshots.
- **PDF Extraction:** Uses PDF.js to extract text from PDFs, then applies VAT extraction logic.
- **Centralized VAT Extraction:** All VAT extraction logic is in `Vat_Formats/extractors.js` for consistency.
